# Spring-Integration-RabbitMQ

This is a simple Spring Boot Application which integrates RabbitMQ using Spring Integration style workflow. 

Please refer [https://github.com/purbarunc/Spring-Boot-RabbitMQ.git](https://github.com/purbarunc/Spring-Boot-RabbitMQ) to use RabbitMQ without Spring Integration style which is a kind of low level way to publish and consume messages from RabbitMQ.

Steps for the local Setup and Test Results are exactly same hence can be referred from the same code repo.
